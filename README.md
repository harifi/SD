**Star Death: a novel lightweight metaheuristic algorithm and its application for dynamic load-balancing in cluster computing**

Due to the presentation of several algorithms in the last two decades, each of which has high complexity and is difficult to understand, providing a lightweight metaheuristic algorithm has become a principle. This code is a new lightweight metaheuristic algorithm called the ***Star Death (SD)*** algorithm, which is inspired by the physical process of star death. The purpose of the SD algorithm is to model the exact, regular, and optimal physical process of star death.
